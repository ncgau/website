			<h1>About NCGAU</h1>
			<p>
				The Newcastle Coders Group is a volunteer run community and meetup centred around a shared
				love of programming, creativity and technology. On the first Wednesday of each month we
				gather to talk tech and share a meal. Meetups are usually attended by twenty or thirty
				people from across the Newcastle software development community
			</p>
			<p>
				A fixture of most meetups is a keynote talk (or two) focused on topics ranging from your
				rights at work to building a music synthesiser using floppy drives.
			</p>
			<p>
				We welcome anyone and everyone interested in software development, from all backgrounds,
				identities and skill levels. Over our 200+ meetups across more than years we've seen our
				fair share of students, career changers, hobbyists, seasoned developers and even CTOs.
